A typical example of RDD-centric functional programming is the following
Scala program that computes the frequencies of all words occurring in a set of text files,
and prints the most common ones , Each map, flatMap (a variant of map) and reduceByKey takes an anonymous function that performs a simple operation on a single data item (or a pair of items)",
 and applies its argument to transform an RDD into a new RDD.
